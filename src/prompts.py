Proposed Interaction Milestones

	1.	Introductory Phase: Review of Transcript & Personality Test
	•	Goal: Get a baseline understanding of the student’s academic history, strengths, and weaknesses.
	•	Interaction: AI reviews the student’s transcript and Clifton Strengths Finder (or similar) report to build a basic bio, including strengths, weaknesses, interests, and extracurricular activities.
	•	Outcome: AI completes the bio with relevant insights for future conversations.
	2.	Exploring Career Interests
	•	Goal: Help the student discover potential career paths.
	•	Interaction: AI asks about career aspirations, favorite subjects, and long-term goals. It may suggest careers based on their academic performance, strengths, and interests.
	•	Outcome: A shortlist of potential career paths for the student to consider.
	3.	Matching Career Paths with Majors
	•	Goal: Connect career aspirations to relevant academic majors.
	•	Interaction: AI presents suitable academic majors for each career path, helping the student understand how different programs can lead to their career goals.
	•	Outcome: A list of majors the student is interested in pursuing.
	4.	Reviewing SUNY Schools and Programs
	•	Goal: Find SUNY schools that offer programs matching the student’s career and academic interests.

	7.	Ongoing Check-ins and Updates
